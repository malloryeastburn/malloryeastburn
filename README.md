- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
    [Sudoku_Solver](https://github.com/malloryeastburn/Sudoku-Solver-PY.git)
      - Currently: Allows user to enter any sudoku puzzle and solves it for user
      - Issues: If player enters an unsolvable puzzle, program never ends
      - Goal: Load in puzzles, allow user to solve, check if solve is valid
   [Text-based_Blackjack](https://github.com/malloryeastburn/Black-Jack-PY.git)
      - Currently: Allows user to play blackjack against dealer

                If user gets blackjack, game ends without checking if dealer has blackjack.
